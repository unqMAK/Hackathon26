        description: "Final Hackathon Problem Statement (One-Liner)\nDesign and develop an AI-enabled Smart Road Damage Reporting and Management System for Solapur Municipal Corporation that enables citizens to report road issues instantly while providing SMC officials with real-time tools for verification, prioritization, resource allocation, and quick resolution.\nSmart Road Damage Reporting & Rapid Response System for Solapur Municipal Corporation\nContext\nSolapur city frequently faces road damage, potholes, and cracks, especially after heavy rains, ongoing construction, and underground utility works. These issues create major safety risks, disrupt traffic, and lead to citizen dissatisfaction.Currently, SMC lacks a centralized, real-time, technology-driven mechanism to detect, verify, prioritize, and resolve road-related complaints efficiently.\nThe Problem\nThe Solapur Municipal Corporation (SMC) needs an integrated digital solution that can:\n1. Detect & Report Road Damage Efficiently\nCitizens face difficulties reporting potholes, cracks, and road breakages.\nCommunication gaps between departments slow down repairs.\nNo visual, geo-tagged or time-stamped system exists for verification.\n2. Coordinate Multi-Departmental Actions\nRoad damage often results from:\nHeavy rain & flooding\nOngoing construction works\nUnderground utility repairs (water, drainage, telecom, electric)\nPoor-quality materials\nHeavy traffic load\nMultiple departments (Engineering, Disaster Management, Traffic, Ward Offices) are involved, but no unified workflow exists.\n3. Enable Real-Time Monitoring & Accountability\nCitizens do not receive timely status updates.\nOfficials lack dashboards to track complaints, delays, or contractor accountability.\nManual processes cause inefficiency and poor transparency.\nHackathon Challenge (What You Must Build)\nHow might we create a Smart, Real-Time Road Damage Reporting and Monitoring System that:\nCitizen Side\nAllows citizens to easily report road damage using photo/video evidence, auto geo-tagging, timestamps, and short descriptions.\nSupports reporting through mobile app, web portal, or WhatsApp bot.\nEnables users to track the status of their complaints.\nSMC Administration Side\nAutomatically categorizes and prioritizes complaints using severity detection (AI preferred).\nCreates a centralized dashboard for officials to assign, monitor, and close tasks.\nIntegrates with SMC departments and contractors for workflow automation.\nSends updates to citizens at each stage.\nMaintains historical and predictive analytics for road maintenance planning.\nAdvanced (Bonus) Features\nAI-based pothole detection from CCTV/traffic feeds.\nPredictive analytics for identifying high-risk areas.\nIntegration with Disaster Management System (DMA Act compliance).\nHeatmaps for tracking road damage across the city.\nExpected Outcomes\nA functional solution that:\nStrengthens citizen–government engagement.\nProvides a faster, transparent, and accountable complaint resolution cycle.\nUses modern technologies (AI, GIS, ML, Automation).\nSupports SMC’s vision of a Smart, Safe, and Efficient Urban Infrastructure.",
